            Our first season ran every third Wednesday at The Dormouse Theatre.
            We were fortunate enough to be able to add additional weekend shows
            for <i>Punishment Park</i> and add a screening for Kalamazoo's theatrical
            premiere of
            <i>The People's Joker</i>. Check out the other screenings below!
