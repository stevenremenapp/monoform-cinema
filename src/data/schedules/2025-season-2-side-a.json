Dunye stars as Cheryl, a video-store clerk and aspiring director with an interest in forgotten Black actresses. This leads her to investigate a 1930s performer known as The Watermelon Woman, whose story proves to have parallels with Cheryl's own life as she navigates a new relationship with a white girlfriend (Guinevere Turner). Balancing breezy romantic comedy with a serious inquiry into the history of Black and queer women in Hollywood, The Watermelon Woman slyly rewrites long-standing constructions of race and sexuality on-screen, introducing an important voice in American cinema.",

Just people vibing.'\n- Letterboxd review\n\nPassion quietly brews between an artist and her subject until together they create a space in which it can briefly flourish, in this sumptuous 18th century romance from one of contemporary French cinema's most acclaimed auteurs. Summoned to an isolated seaside estate on a secret assignment, Marianne must find a way to furtively paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse, who is resisting chattel marriage. What unfolds is an exchange of sustained gazes in which the two women come to know each other's gestures, expressions, and bodies with rapturous intimacy, ultimately forging a subversive creative collaboration as well as a delirious romance. Charged with a yearning that almost transcends time and space, <i style='display: contents'>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> mines the emotional and artistic possibilities that emerge when women can freely live together and see one another in a world without men.",

As Nazi forces encroach on his small village in what is now known as Belarus, teenage Flyora (Alexei Kravchenko, in a searing depiction of anguish) eagerly joins the Soviet resistance. Rather than the adventure and glory he envisioned, what he finds is a waking nightmare of unimaginable carnage and cruelty—rendered with a feverish, otherworldly intensity by Klimov's subjective camera work and expressionistic sound design. Nearly blocked from being made by Soviet censors, who took seven years to approve its script, <i style='display: contents'>Come and See</i> is perhaps the most visceral, impossible-to-forget antiwar film ever made.",

Through a rapid-fire combination of melodrama, comedy, horror, documentary and experimental film, director Toshio Matsumoto's freewheeling approach to both genre and form results in a film that gleefully disorientates without ever feeling disjointed. Made at a point in cinema history when radically-minded filmmakers were testing, breaking and redefining the limits of good filmmaking and taste, Matsumoto's movie attacks on both fronts with an irrepressible fervor, creating a film that has retained its power to surprise, delight and shock 55 years later.\n\nAn unknown club dancer at the time, trans actor Peter (from Kurosawa's Ran) gives an astonishing Edie Sedgwick/Warhol superstar-like performance as Eddie, hostess at Bar Genet—where she's ignited a violent love triangle with reigning drag queen Leda (Osamu Ogasawara) for the attentions of club owner Gonda (Yoshio Tsuchiya, from Seven Samurai and Yojimbo). Director Toshio Matsumoto's shattering, kaleidoscopic masterpiece is a key work of the Japanese New Wave and of queer cinema, and one of the most subversive and intoxicating films of the late 1960s.",
