Dunye stars as Cheryl, a video-store clerk and aspiring director with an interest in forgotten Black actresses. This leads her to investigate a 1930s performer known as The Watermelon Woman, whose story proves to have parallels with Cheryl's own life as she navigates a new relationship with a white girlfriend (Guinevere Turner). Balancing breezy romantic comedy with a serious inquiry into the history of Black and queer women in Hollywood, The Watermelon Woman slyly rewrites long-standing constructions of race and sexuality on-screen, introducing an important voice in American cinema.",

Just people vibing.'\n- Letterboxd review\n\nPassion quietly brews between an artist and her subject until together they create a space in which it can briefly flourish, in this sumptuous 18th century romance from one of contemporary French cinema's most acclaimed auteurs. Summoned to an isolated seaside estate on a secret assignment, Marianne must find a way to furtively paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse, who is resisting chattel marriage. What unfolds is an exchange of sustained gazes in which the two women come to know each other's gestures, expressions, and bodies with rapturous intimacy, ultimately forging a subversive creative collaboration as well as a delirious romance. Charged with a yearning that almost transcends time and space, <i style='display: contents'>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i> mines the emotional and artistic possibilities that emerge when women can freely live together and see one another in a world without men.",

Basel documents the gradual erasure of Masafer Yatta, as soldiers destroy the homes of families - the largest single act of forced transfer ever carried out in the occupied West Bank. He crosses paths with Yuval, an Israeli journalist who joins his struggle, and for over half a decade they fight against the expulsion while growing closer. Their complex bond is haunted by the extreme inequality between them: Basel, living under a brutal military occupation, and Yuval, unrestricted and free. This film, by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four young activists, was co-created during the darkest, most terrifying times in the region, as an act of creative resistance to Apartheid and a search for a path towards equality and justice.\n\n<u>DIRECTORS' STATEMENT</u>\nWe're making this film together, a Palestinian-Israeli group of activists and filmmakers, because we want to stop the ongoing expulsion of the community of Masafer Yatta, and resist the reality of Apartheid we were born into - from opposite, unequal sides. Reality around us is becoming scarier, more violent, more oppressive, every day - and we are very weak in front of it. We can only shout out something radically different, this film - which at its core, is a proposal for an alternate way Israelis and Palestinians can live in this land - not as oppressor and oppressed, but in full equality.",

Through a rapid-fire combination of melodrama, comedy, horror, documentary and experimental film, director Toshio Matsumoto's freewheeling approach to both genre and form results in a film that gleefully disorientates without ever feeling disjointed. Made at a point in cinema history when radically-minded filmmakers were testing, breaking and redefining the limits of good filmmaking and taste, Matsumoto's movie attacks on both fronts with an irrepressible fervor, creating a film that has retained its power to surprise, delight and shock 55 years later.\n\nAn unknown club dancer at the time, trans actor Peter (from Kurosawa's Ran) gives an astonishing Edie Sedgwick/Warhol superstar-like performance as Eddie, hostess at Bar Genet—where she's ignited a violent love triangle with reigning drag queen Leda (Osamu Ogasawara) for the attentions of club owner Gonda (Yoshio Tsuchiya, from Seven Samurai and Yojimbo). Director Toshio Matsumoto's shattering, kaleidoscopic masterpiece is a key work of the Japanese New Wave and of queer cinema, and one of the most subversive and intoxicating films of the late 1960s.",

        "description": "<i style='display: contents'>Starship Troopers</i> is one of the most misunderstood films of the 1990s, perhaps of all time. Under the guise of a patriotic sci-fi action story, director Paul Verhoeven indicts American culture as not just neo-colonial, but as neo-fascist. The film satirizes the problematic pro-war sentiment of Robert Heinlein's novel and fully leans into camp, while slyly depicting fascism's transmission through information control and propaganda.\n\nSet in the 23rd century, the story follows a young soldier named Johnny Rico and his exploits in the military of the United Citizen Federation, a worldwide government. Rico's military career progresses from recruit to non-commissioned officer and finally to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between mankind and an arachnoid species known only as “the Bugs.”\n\nThe only good movie is a Monoform movie!

        "description": "Released just one year after Roe V. Wade, and often cited as the very first slasher film, it might surprise you to learn that Bob Clark's 1974 holiday horror film Black Christmas is overtly feminist, and explores themes of abortion, misogyny and female sexuality. Surrounded by cheery decorations and cozy Christmas lights, a phone is ringing. A small group of sorority girls have been receiving increasingly threatening and obscene phone calls. When one of the girls goes missing, both fear and frustrations arise as their concerns are not taken seriously by police. As the situation becomes more complicated, the girls must question the motives of even the men closest to them.\n\nWith standout performances by Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder, a chilling soundscape, scenes that are still shocking and themes that are still relevant 50 years later, Black Christmas is a truly scary Christmas classic!",
